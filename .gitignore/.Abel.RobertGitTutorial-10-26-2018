What is GitHub? When was it created? Why? By who? What similar platforms exist? Why would you use such a platform? (Answer between 5 and 10 lines)

Github is a web/cloud-based repository hosting service mostly used for posting computer code. The platform was created in 2008 as Logical Awesome LLC by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, P .J. Hyett, and Scott Chacon and in June of this year was acquired by Microsoft. The platform is used by programmers to post their code and companies also use the platform to share open source code which allows developers to share code inviting any and everyone to help improve upon existing platforms or use for their own private purposes. It can also be used a virtual portfolio to display a programmer's previous projects. 

Define the following terms in the context of Git (2 lines maximum):
"	Repository
Similar to a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private
"	Commit
A revision  or change to a file, similar to when you save a file, except with Git, every time you save it creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of what changes were made when and by who.
"	Push
A push is sending a committed change to a remote repository, such as a repository hosted on GitHub. For example something changed locally, would push those changes so that others may access them.
"	Branch
A parallel version of a repository contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or master branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version.
"	Fork
A personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account which allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original. Forks remain attached to the original, allowing you to submit a pull request to the original's author to update with your changes. 

"	Merge
Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another. This often happens as a pull request (which can be thought of as a request to merge), or via the command line. A merge can be done automatically via a pull request via the GitHub web interface if there are no conflicting changes, or can always be done via the command line.

"	Clone
A copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy. With your clone you can edit the files in your preferred editor and use Git to keep track of your changes without having to be online. It is, however, connected to the remote version so that changes can be synced between the two.

"	Pull 
When you are fetching in changes and merging them. For instance, if someone has edited the remote file you're both working on, you'll want to pull in those changes to your local copy so that it's up to date.
"	Pull request 
Proposed changes to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by a repository's collaborators. Like issues, pull requests each have their own discussion forum.
